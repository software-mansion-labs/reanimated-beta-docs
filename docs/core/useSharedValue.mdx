# useSharedValue

`useSharedValue` is a hook that lets you define [shared values](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#shared-value) in your components.

## Reference

```javascript
import { useSharedValue } from "react-native-reanimated";

function App() {
  const sharedValue = useSharedValue(100);

  // read a shared value
  console.log(sharedValue.value);

  // and modify it
  sharedValue.value += 50;
}
```

<details>
<summary>Type definitions</summary>

```typescript
type SharedValue<T> = { value: T };

function useSharedValue<T>(initialValue: T): SharedValue<T>;
```

</details>

### Arguments

#### `initialValue`

The value you want to be initially stored to a `.value` property. It can be any JavaScript value like `number`, `string` or `boolean` but also data structures such as `array` and `object`.

### Returns

`useSharedValue` returns a shared value with a single `value` property initially set to the `initialValue`.

Values stored in shared values can be accessed and modified by their `.value` property.

## Example

import SharedValue from "@site/src/examples/SharedValue";
import SharedValueSrc from "!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/SharedValue";

<InteractiveExample src={SharedValueSrc} component={<SharedValue />} showCode />

## Caveats

- When you change the `sharedValue.value` Reanimated will update the styles and keep the shared value in sync between the threads. However, this won't trigger a typical React re-render because a shared value is a plain JavaScript object.
- When you change the `sharedValue.value` update on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread) will happen synchronously. On the other hand, on the [JavaScript thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#javascript-thread) update is asynchronous. This means when you try to immediately log the `value` after the change it will log the previously stored value.

```javascript
function App() {
  const sharedValue = useSharedValue(100); // initially set 100

  sharedValue.value += 50; // changing value stored in a shared value

  console.log(value); // will still log 100
}
```

- Stay away from [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) when working with shared values. While this is a completely valid JavaScript code it will make Reanimated unable to keep the reactivity of a shared value.

```javascript
function App() {
  let { value } = sharedValue; // don't do this

  console.log(value); // you can read the value just fine

  value += 50; // but this won't update the styles
}
```
