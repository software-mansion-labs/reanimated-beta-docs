# measure

`measure` lets you synchronously get the dimensions and the position of a view on the screen.

If you need the measurements as soon as possible and you don't need `pageX` and `pageY`, consider using the [`onLayout`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#onlayout) property instead.

## Reference

```javascript
import { measure } from "react-native-reanimated";

function App() {
  const animatedRef = useAnimatedRef();

  const handlePress = () => {
    runOnUI(() => {
      // highlight-next-line
      const measurement = measure(animatedRef);
    })();
  };

  // ...
}
```

<summary>Type definitions</summary>

```typescript
interface MeasuredDimensions {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  pageX: number;
  pageY: number;
}

function measure<T extends Component>(
  ref: RefObject<T>
): MeasuredDimensions | null;
```

</details>

### Arguments

#### `animatedRef`

An [animated ref](/) connected to the component you'd want to get the measurements from. The animated ref has to be passed to an [Animated component](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#animated-component).

### Returns

`measure` returns an object containing these fields:

- `x`
- `y`
- `width`
- `height`
- `pageX`
- `pageY`

It returns `null` when the measurement couldn't be performed.

## Example

import MeasureBasic from "@site/src/examples/MeasureBasic";
import MeasureBasicSrc from "!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/MeasureBasic";

<InteractiveExample src={MeasureBasicSrc} component={<MeasureBasic />} />

## Caveats

- `measure` is only implemented on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread)
-
